#+TITLE: Allow omisharp to manage .cs files outside server-project-root

I have a folder structure where some =.csproj= and their =.cs= files
live outside of the directory where the =.sln= file resides. The
folder structure looks something like this:

#+begin_example

<common root>
      |
      +-- projects
      |          |
      |          +-- project1.csproj
      |                     |
      |                     +-- subdirs with .cs files
      |
      +-- solution
             |
             +-- my.sln
             |
             +-- project2_subdir
             |          |
             |          +-- project2.csproj
             |                     |
             |                     +-- subdirs with .cs files
             |
             +-- project3_subdir
                        |
                        +-- project3.csproj
                                   |
                                   +-- subdirs with .cs files
#+end_example

When I call =omnisharp-start-server= with (the path to) =my.sln= I get
intellisense in all =.cs= files below the =solution= subdirectory. In all
=.cs= files below the =projects= directory I only get the message

#+begin_example
omnisharp: buffer will not be managed by omnisharp: <filename> is outside the root directory of the project loaded on the current OmniSharp server: <solution directory>.
#+end_example

The projects in =projects= dir are however part of =my.sln=.
